## ‚≠ê Overview

NutriMate is a cutting-edge backend API that revolutionizes recipe discovery by combining advanced machine learning with intuitive, image-based input. It's designed to be the intelligent core for any culinary application, offering highly personalized and flexible recipe recommendations.

> "In an era of diverse dietary preferences and ever-changing culinary trends, finding the perfect recipe can be a daunting task. Traditional recipe platforms often lack the flexibility to adapt to unique ingredient combinations, image-based queries, or nuanced user preferences, leading to culinary frustration and wasted ingredients."

NutriMate elegantly solves this by providing a robust, intelligent API capable of analyzing food images, processing complex user inputs, and delivering highly personalized recipe recommendations from a vast, continually updated database. It transforms the way users interact with recipes, making meal planning effortless and inspiring.

**Inferred Architecture:**
This project is a Python-based RESTful API, built on the Flask framework, designed for scalability and intelligent data processing. It employs a modular architecture featuring distinct services for data ingestion (leveraging multiple web scrapers), advanced AI-driven image analysis (utilizing Google Gemini), a sophisticated machine learning-powered recommendation engine, and robust data management utilities. Precomputed models and features optimize performance for real-time recommendations, while Dockerization ensures seamless deployment and consistent environments.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Image-to-Recipe Analysis (Gemini AI):** üì∏
    Leverage the power of Google's Gemini API to analyze food images uploaded by users. NutriMate intelligently identifies potential ingredients and food types within an image, transforming visual cues into concrete, tailored recipe suggestions. This innovative feature makes recipe discovery more intuitive than ever before.
*   **Flexible Recipe Recommendation Engine:** üß†
    At its core, NutriMate features a powerful `FlexibleRecipeRecommendationSystem`. This engine generates highly personalized recipe recommendations based on diverse criteria such as user-provided ingredients, dietary preferences, culinary categories, and keyword searches. It utilizes advanced weighted similarity algorithms and precomputed feature matrices for fast, relevant results.
*   **Dynamic Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** üåê
    The API is designed to maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date recipe dataset. It includes a suite of robust web scrapers (for platforms like AllRecipes, Food.com, Food Network, Google, and Wikimedia) that automatically collect and process raw recipe data. Intelligent preprocessing utilities handle varied data formats, including complex R-vector strings and list-like fields, ensuring high-quality input for the recommendation engine.
*   **Optimized Feature Engineering:** üìä
    NutriMate employs sophisticated feature engineering techniques to convert raw recipe attributes into machine learning-ready formats. It creates TF-IDF vectors for keywords and ingredients, category dummy variables, and scaled numerical features, all precomputed and stored for efficient, real-time query processing.
*   **Scalable & Deployable API:** üöÄ
    Built on the lightweight Flask framework and served by Gunicorn, NutriMate is designed for production-ready deployment. It fully supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to enable secure communication with diverse frontend applications and includes a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization and consistent deployment across various environments.
*   **Health Monitoring Endpoint:** ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
    A simple `/health` endpoint is provided to monitor the API's operational status, ensuring it's responsive and available for requests.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get NutriMate API up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.9+**
*   **pip** (Python package installer)
*   **Docker** (Optional, but recommended for consistent deployment)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samarthhitnalli/NutrimateBackend.git
    cd NutrimateBackend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, based on `config.py`. You'll need API keys for Google Gemini (and potentially OpenAI if configured).

    ```dotenv
    # .env
    # Example for Google Generative AI
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    *Refer to the Google Cloud AI documentation to obtain your Gemini API key.*

## üîß Usage

Once the API is installed and configured, you can run it locally and interact with its endpoints.

### Running the API

You can run the application using `gunicorn` (for a production-like setup) or directly with Flask's development server.

**Using Gunicorn (Recommended):**

```bash
gunicorn -w 4 'app.main:create_app()' --bind 0.0.0.0:5000
```
This command starts Gunicorn with 4 worker processes, binding the Flask application created by `create_app()` in `app/main.py` to port 5000.

### API Endpoints

Here are some example `curl` commands to interact with the API:

1.  **Health Check:**

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:5000/health
    ```
    Expected output:
    ```json
    {"status": "ok"}
    ```

2.  **Get Recipe Recommendations (Example):**
    This endpoint would typically accept a JSON payload with user preferences or ingredients.
    *(Note: The exact endpoint and payload format are inferred from `routes.py` and `form_data.json`.)*

    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
             "keywords": ["chicken", "rice"],
             "categories": ["dinner", "asian"],
             "min_ingredients": 3,
             "max_calories": 800
         }' \
         http://localhost:5000/api/v1/recommend
    ```
    *Replace the JSON payload with your specific query parameters.*

3.  **Analyze Food Image (Example):**
    This endpoint would likely accept an image file (e.g., via `multipart/form-data`) or a URL to an image. The API then uses Gemini to analyze the image.
    *(Note: The exact endpoint and payload format are inferred from `image_query.py`.)*

    ```bash
    # Example: Analyze an image from a local file
    curl -X POST \
         -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
         -F "image=@/path/to/your/food_image.jpg" \
         http://localhost:5000/api/v1/analyze-image
    ```
    *Replace `/path/to/your/food_image.jpg` with the actual path to your image file.*
